# Constitution: Vegan / Vegetarian (The Engineered Plant-Based Protocol)
**Metabolic Logic: Architectural Intent & Anti-Nutrient Mitigation**

## 1. The Engineered Laws (Parameters)
- **The Anabolic Floor (Protein)**: 
  - *Minimum (Active)*: 1.6g per kg of body weight.
  - *Optimal (Performance)*: 2.0g - 2.4g per kg (accounts for the "Fiber Shield" and lower bioavailability).
- **The Leucine Threshold**: 2.5g - 3.0g of Leucine per meal is the non-negotiable switch for Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS). 
- **The Methylation Floor (B12)**: 50-100 mcg daily (Cyanocobalamin) or 2000 mcg weekly. *Note: Folate from greens can mask B12 deficiency in standard blood tests.*
- **The Oxygen Floor (Iron)**: 
  - *Ferritin Target*: >30 ng/mL (Minimum), >50-100 ng/mL (Performance).
  - *Absorption*: Must be paired with Vitamin C (300-400% increase).
- **The Zinc Premium**: Target +50% over standard RDA (15-20mg daily) to overcome the "Phytate Blockade."
- **The Algal Bypass (Omega-3)**: 250mg - 2g/day of preformed EPA/DHA from Algal Oil. (Bypasses the <0.5% conversion rate of flax/chia).

## 2. Decision Heuristics (Actions)
- **IF [Objective: Muscle Growth / Maintenance]**:
  - *ACTION 1*: **Leucine Spiking**. Fortify plant meals with 1-2g free-form L-Leucine or target 25g Soy Isolate per serving.
  - *ACTION 2*: **The Protein Stacking Algorithm**. Combine Grains (Low Lysine) + Legumes (High Lysine) every 24 hours (e.g., Rice + Beans, Peanut Butter + Bread).
- **IF [Symptom: Fatigue / Low Recovery / Cold Sensitivity]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: Functional Malnutrition (Iron or Zinc deficiency).
  - *ACTION*: **The Anti-Nutrient Protocol**. Soak, sprout, or ferment all grains/legumes to deactivate phytates. Pair iron-rich meals with Citrus; separate from Tea/Coffee by 90 mins.
- **IF [Event: Buying "Plant-Based" Meat Analogues]**:
  - *AUDIT*: Check for the **UPF Trap**. If Sodium is >300% of meat or Saturated Fat (Coconut Oil) is high, it is a "Transitional Tool," not a staple.
- **IF [Symptom: "Tired but Wired" / Nerve Issues]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: B12 "Methylation Trap."
  - *ACTION*: Immediate standardized B12 supplementation. Do not rely on "Natural" sources like seaweed or unwashed veg.

## 3. Truth Anchors (Scientific Constants)
- **Naturalistic Fallacy**: "Plant-derived" does not equal "metabolically optimized." A vegan diet is an engineered state, not a natural default.
- **The Fiber Shield**: Intact plant cells protect protein from enzymes. You must eat MORE plant protein to get the SAME net result as animal protein.
- **The Seitan Trap**: Seitan is mass without quality. It possesses zero Lysine and is functionally invisible to the muscle-building machinery unless paired with Soy/Lentils.

## 4. Visual Benchmarks (Truth Calibration)
- **The Truth Anchor Plate**: **Tempeh** (The Fermented King) or **Lentils** (The Lysine Reservoir) + high-volume greens + **Hemp Seeds** (The Fatty Acid Anchor).
- **The Anabolic Anchor**: A 25g Soy Isolate shake or fortified Pea/Rice blend (The Leucine Spike).
- **Red Flag**: "Junk Food Vegan" phenotype—heavy reliance on white pasta, bread, refined sugar, and hyper-processed "Vegan" convenience foods.
