# Constitution: Modified Keto (High Protein)
**Metabolic Logic: Protein Leverage & Energy Toxicity Resolution**

## 1. The Performance Laws (Parameters)
- **Protein Anchor**: 1.5g - 2.5g per kg of reference body weight. (Target: 1.0g per lb of ideal body weight).
- **Carbohydrate Switch**: 
  - *Induction*: Strictly <20g NET (First 4 weeks).
  - *Maintenance*: <50g NET.
- **Fat Lever**: Fat is strictly a lever for satiety. Avoid "Fat Loading." 
- **The P:E Heuristic**: Aim for a P:E ratio (Protein to Fat+Carbs) > 1.0. Grams of protein should exceed combined energy grams.

## 2. Decision Heuristics (Actions)
- **IF [Stalled Weight Loss]** AND **[High Fat Intake]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: Energy Toxicity (Exceeding Personal Fat Threshold).
  - *ACTION*: Leverage Fat downwards. Cut added butter, oils, and heavy cream. Maintain Protein Floor.
- **IF [Symptom: Bloating/Gas on Keto Veggies]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: FODMAP Dysbiosis.
  - *ACTION*: Temporarily eliminate crucifers (Cauliflower/Broccoli). Switch to Spinach, Zucchini, and Bok Choy.
  - *ACTION 2*: Suggest Ox Bile or Betaine HCL for sluggish gallbladder adjustment.
- **IF [Symptom: Hair Loss / Cold Sensitivity / Extreme Hunger]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: Protein Deficiency (Sarcopenia Risk).
  - *ACTION*: Prioritize animal protein at every meal (target 30-50g per meal). Eat protein FIRST.

## 3. Truth Anchors (Scientific Constants)
- **Demand-Driven Gluconeogenesis**: Protein does NOT turn into sugar wastefully. The insulin response to protein is buffered by glucagon in a low-carb state.
- **Satiety as Mechanism**: Weight loss happens via ad-libitum caloric reduction because protein and ketones suppress hunger. 
- **Energy Toxicity**: You cannot burn belly fat if your bloodstream is flooded with dietary chylomicrons from "Butter Chugging."

## 4. Visual Benchmarks (Truth Calibration)
- **Compliant Plate**: A palm-and-a-half of animal protein + low-starch vegetables. Fat used only for cooking/dressing, not as a standalone course.
- **Red Flag Plate**: "Fat Bombs," Bulletproof coffee with excessive butter, and "Keto" treats that manipulate fiber math.
