# Constitution: Hypertrophy & Weight Training (The Metabolic Truth Engine)
**Metabolic Logic: Mechanotransduction & Volumetric Management**

## 1. The Laws of Growth (Parameters)
- **The Primacy of Mechanical Tension**: Tension is the signal. High-threshold motor units (HTMUs) are recruited only under heavy load (>80% 1RM) or high effort (0-3 Reps in Reserve).
- **The Equated Outcomes Principle**: Hypertrophy occurs across the 5-30 rep spectrum, provided failure proximity is reached. "Gear Shifting" allows training around joint pain.
- **The Failure Proximity Rule**: A working set is defined as **0-4 RIR**. Sets at 5+ RIR are "junk volume"—they generate systemic fatigue without local growth stimulus.
- **Stimulus-to-Fatigue Ratio (SFR)**: Every exercise is a transaction. Maximize local disruption (Hypertrophy) while minimizing systemic cost (CNS/Joint drain).
- **Volume Parabolic**: Volume follows a curve of diminishing returns. Identify individual MV (Maintenance), MEV (Minimum), MAV (Adaptive), and MRV (Recoverable) landmarks.

## 2. Decision Heuristics (Actions)
- **IF [Current Goal: Muscle Hypertrophy]**:
  - *HEURISTIC*: **The SFR Matrix**. Prioritize "Golden Zone" exercises (Hack Squats, DB Lateral Raises, Converging Machines) for 70-80% of volume to maximize stimulus-per-unit-fatigue.
- **IF [Program Logic: Progressive Overload]**:
  - *ALGORITHM*: **Technique > Reps > Weight > Sets**. 
  - *RULE*: Do not add weight unless form is "Standardized." Add reps first; add weight only when hitting the ceiling of the target rep range. Add sets only when progress stalls or climbing from MEV to MRV.
- **IF [Symptom: Regression in Strength / Disrupted Sleep / High Joint Pain]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: Functional Overreaching / MRV Exceeded.
  - *ACTION*: **Immediate Deload**. Drop volume by 50% and intensity (load) by 10-20% for one week to flush fatigue.
- **IF [Recovery Phase: Post-Workout Activation]**:
  - *HEURISTIC*: **The Parasympathetic Switch**. 3-5 minutes of Box Breathing immediately post-training to shift from catabolic Sympathetic drive to anabolic recovery.

## 3. Volume Landmark Database (Intermediate/Advanced)
| Muscle Group | MV | MEV | MAV | MRV | Kinesiological Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chest** | 8 | 10 | 12-20 | 22 | Limited by shoulder girdle health. |
| **Back** | 8 | 10 | 14-22 | 25 | High fatigue tolerance; varied vectors (Y/X planes). |
| **Quadriceps**| 6 | 8 | 12-18 | 20 | Massive systemic cost (The "Taxing Zone"). |
| **Hamstrings**| 4 | 6 | 10-16 | 20 | Prone to EIMD; slow recovery. |
| **Side Delts** | 6 | 8 | 16-22 | 26+ | Low systemic cost; train frequently. |
| **Biceps** | 4-6 | 8 | 14-20 | 26 | Limited by distal bicep tendon health. |
| **Front Delts** | 0 | 0 | 6-8 | 12 | Usually "over-stimulated" via chest pressing. |

## 4. Truth Anchors (Scientific Constants)
- **Mechanotransduction**: Physical cellular deformation (titin/integrin) is the "Source Code" of growth. Strength is a neurological skill; hypertrophy is a material adaptation.
- **The "Taxing Zone"**: Exercises like Deadlifts and Back Squats have low SFR for pure hypertrophy. Use them as specialists, not volume drivers.
- **The Long Muscle Length Advantage**: Training in the stretched position (e.g., deep deficit pushups, cambered bar) provides superior hypertrophy via passive + active tension.
- **The Cold Water Caveat (Post-Training)**: Cold water immersion immediately after lifting blunts the acute inflammation required for adaptive signaling. **Wait 4-6 hours** or use on rest days only.
- **The Anabolic Baseline**: Growth is impossible without ~1.6g-2.2g Protein / kg Bodyweight and >7 hours of sleep. Bio-hacking cannot bypass these raw materials.
