# Constitution: Clinical Ketogenic (WFKD)
**Metabolic Logic: Insulin Correction & Adaptability**

## 1. The Clinical Laws (Parameters)
- **Carbohydrate Ceiling**: 
  - *Therapeutic*: <30g TOTAL (Strict induction / Insulin resistance).
  - *Standard*: <50g TOTAL (General metabolic health).
- **Protein Floor**: 1.2g - 1.7g per kg of reference body weight. (Standard metabolic maintenance).
- **Fat Lever**: 70-80% of calories during induction; leverage downwards for weight loss once adapted.
- **Electrolyte Floor (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
  - **Sodium**: 3,000mg - 5,000mg (Daily Requirement).
  - **Potassium**: 3,000mg - 4,000mg (Preferably from food: Avocado, Spinach).
  - **Magnesium**: 300mg - 500mg (Preferably Glycinate at bedtime).

## 2. Decision Heuristics (Actions)
- **IF [Symptom: Headache/Dizziness/Fatigue]** AND **[Diet_Age < 14 Days]**:
  - *ASSUMPTION*: Sodium Deficiency (Keto Flu).
  - *ACTION*: Prescribe 1/2 tsp salt in water immediately. Observe for 20 mins.
- **IF [Symptom: High Fasting Glucose (Dawn Phenomenon)]**:
  - *ACTION 1*: Move final meal 3-4 hours prior to sleep.
  - *ACTION 2*: Suggest 1 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar (diluted) before bed.
- **IF [Event: Accidental Carb Overload (Cheat)]**:
  - *ACTION 1*: Immediate Mechanical Clearance (15-20m Zone 2 cardio).
  - *ACTION 2*: 16-hour fasting reset.
  - *ACTION 3*: Resume standard WFKD macros immediately (No punitive restriction).

## 3. Truth Anchors (Scientific Constants)
- **Hormonal Priority**: "You cannot burn fat in the presence of high insulin." Correct the hormone first; calories second.
- **Dirty Keto Trap**: Avoid Omega-6 industrial seed oils (Soybean, Canola). High OXLAMs neutralize the anti-inflammatory benefits of BHB.
- **Salt is Life**: In a low-insulin state, salt retention is disabled. Salt is the fundamental requirement for blood volume.

## 4. Visual Benchmarks (Truth Calibration)
- **Compliant Plate**: 4-6oz high-quality animal protein (steak, salmon) + large serving of leafy greens/crucifers + healthy fats (butter/olive oil/avocado).
- **Red Flag Plate**: Processed "Keto" bars, grain-alternative breads, or deep-fried foods in seed oils.
