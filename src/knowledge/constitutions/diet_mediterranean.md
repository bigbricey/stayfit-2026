# Constitution: Mediterranean / Longevity (The Green-Med Protocol)
**Metabolic Logic: Polyphenol Density & Visceral Fat Incineration**

## 1. The Longevity Laws (Parameters)
- **The Lipid Golden Ratio**: 1 : 2 : 5 (PUFA : SFA : MUFA).
  - *SFA Ceiling*: < 8-10% of total calories (Standard: 8% per Cretan Benchmark).
  - *MUFA Floor*: > 25% of total calories (Source: Heavy Extra Virgin Olive Oil).
  - *Omega Ratio*: 2:1 to 4:1 (Omega-6 to Omega-3).
- **The Fiber Floor**: > 30g/day (Target: 40-50g for metabolic repair).
- **The Green Standard (Polyphenol Floor)**: +1,240mg of daily polyphenols.
  - *Mandatory*: 3-4 cups Green Tea + 28g Walnuts + Daily leafy green/Mankai surge.
- **Micro-Nutrient Floor (B12/Iron/Zinc)**: Must be monitored if meat is strictly limited. Mankai or Fatty Fish (Sardines/Salmon) are the primary corrective anchors.

## 2. Decision Heuristics (Actions)
- **IF [Objective: Reversing Liver Fat / Visceral Adiposity]**:
  - *ACTION*: Shift to **Green-Med Optimized Mode**. Remove all Red/Processed Meat. Introduce the "Mankai/Green Shake" in the evening window (Low Glycemic Restoration).
- **IF [Symptom: Muscle Loss / Sarcopenia Risk (Elderly)]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: Anabolic Resistance.
  - *ACTION 1*: Increase Protein to 1.2g - 1.5g per kg.
  - *ACTION 2*: Prioritize "Pesco-Hybrid" Lunch (150g Fatty Fish) to hit the 2.5g Leucine threshold.
- **IF [Symptom: Afternoon Energy Crash]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: Glycemic Toxicity (Grain-Heavy Distortion).
  - *ACTION*: Ruthlessly demote grains. Legumes (Lentils/Chickpeas) become the primary carbohydrate base.
- **IF [Event: Purchasing Oil]**:
  - *AUDIT*: Must be **Extra Virgin** (EVOO). If the oil does not "sting" the throat, the polyphenol count is functionally zero.

## 3. Truth Anchors (Scientific Constants)
- **The Visceral Fat Gap**: The Green-Med protocol achieves double the visceral fat loss compared to standard Mediterranean diets at the same caloric intake. Polyphenols drive the fat incineration.
- **Vegetable Illusion**: A side salad is insufficient. Compliance requires 7-9 servings (400-600g) of plant matter daily.
- **Anabolic Threshold**: Plant protein alone often misses the Leucine trigger for muscle growth. Supplement with fish or high-density green protein (Mankai).

## 4. Visual Benchmarks (Truth Calibration)
- **The Metabolic Lunch**: A mixing-bowl-sized salad (50% volume) + 150g Fatty Fish + 28g Walnuts + Visible EVOO coating. No bread.
- **The Restoration Dinner**: Liquid-dominant or soft-solid. Emerald Green Mankai shake or Vegetable/Lentil soup. Absence of "beige" starches.
- **Red Flag**: Refined pasta/pizza as staples, "pure/light" olive oil, and high-SFA animal fats (butter/cream) exceeding the 10% ceiling.
