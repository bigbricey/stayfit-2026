# Constitution: Calisthenics & Bodyweight (The Architecture of Self-Resistance)
**Metabolic Logic: Leverage Manipulation & Connective Tissue Integrity**

## 1. The Laws of Gravity (Parameters)
- **Connective Tissue Priority**: Muscular adaptation outpaces tendinous adaptation. "Patience is Velocity." Violating this gap leads to "Structural Deficit" and injury (e.g., Golfer's Elbow in OAC work).
- **Strength as a Skill**: Force generation is a neurological product. Use **Synaptic Facilitation** (Grease the Groove) to myelinate motor patterns without inducing metabolic fatigue.
- **The Planes of Balance**: Every Push must have an equal Pull, across both Vertical and Horizontal planes. Neglect leads to the "Hunchback" postural collapse.
- **Mechanical Advantage**: Calisthenics is the art of manipulating the **Moment Arm**. Shorten the lever (Tuck) to regress; lengthen (Straddle/Full) to progress.
- **FIG Quality Standard**: A hold must be 2.0 seconds of "Stone-Still" tension to be recognized as a "Truth." Shaking or "Muscle-ing" a rep is a failure of ownership.

## 2. Decision Heuristics (Actions)
- **IF [Current Goal: Connective Tissue / Tendon Density]**:
  - *HEURISTIC*: **The Steady State Cycle (SSC)**. Arrest progress for 8-12 weeks at a sub-maximal load (50-80%). Do not add seconds. Allow the collagen matrix to "catch up" to the engine.
- **IF [Current Goal: Pure Skill Acquisition (e.g., Handstand, Pull-up)]**:
  - *HEURISTIC*: **Grease the Groove (GtG)**. Multiple sets (4-8) spread throughout the day at 40-50% intensity. Stay "fresh"; never train to failure in this mode.
- **IF [Symptom: Elbow/Shoulder Tendonitis]**:
  - *ACTION*: Immediate transition to **Eccentric-Only** loading or regression to a "Tuck" node on the Skill Tree. Stop the "Pre-Hab" leak before it breaks the system.
- **IF [Workout: Intermediate/Advanced Plateau]**:
  - *HEURISTIC*: **Daily Undulating Periodization (DUP)**. Undulate between Strength (Mon), Hypertrophy (Wed), and Power/Skill (Fri) to manage systemic CNS fatigue.

## 3. The Skill Tree Logic (Progression Pathways)
- **Vertical Pull (The OAC Path)**: Pull-up -> Chest-to-Bar -> Weighted Pull-up (50% BW) -> Archer -> Eccentrics -> One-Arm Chin-up.
- **Vertical Push (The HSPU Path)**: Pike Push-up -> Elevated Pike -> Chest-to-Wall HSPU (Truth Anchor) -> Freestanding HSPU.
- **Horizontal Pull (The Front Lever Path)**: Row -> Tuck FL -> Advanced Tuck (Flat Back) -> Straddle -> Full Front Lever (**Neutral/Depressed Scapula**).
- **Horizontal Push (The Planche Path)**: PPPU (Lean) -> Tuck Planche -> Advanced Tuck -> Straddle -> Full Planche (**Maximal Protraction/Depression**).
- **The Hybrid (Muscle-up)**: **False Grip** is the truth anchor. Master the Strict MU to protect the elbows before attempting the high dynamic forces of a Kipping MU.

## 4. Truth Anchors (Scientific Constants)
- **Leverage Geometry**: Torque = Force x Distance. If you gain 2kg, your Planche leverage requirement increases exponentially. Calisthenics is a game of power-to-weight ratio.
- **The "Dead-Stop" Truth**: Any rep that uses momentum (kipping without intent) is a metabolic lie. The AI prioritizes "from zero" tension.
- **Structural Integrity Check**: Can you hold a **Crow Stand** for 60s? If no, your wrist-to-elbow stability is insufficient for Planche work.
- **Energy System Partitioning**: Train **Skills** in the ATP-CP zone (100% fresh, long rest). Train **Capacity/Basics** in the Glycolytic zone. Mixing them indiscriminately leads to mediocre neural signals.
