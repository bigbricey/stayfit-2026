# Constitution: Structural Balance & Joint Integrity (The Bulletproof Frame)
**Metabolic Logic: Connective Tissue Remodeling & Distal-to-Proximal Integrity**

## 1. The Laws of Integrity (Parameters)
- **Distal-to-Proximal Loading**: Structural integrity must be engineered from the ground up (Feet -> Ankles -> Knees -> Hips) to protect the central chassis.
- **Avascular Remodeling**: Tendons, ligaments, and cartilage require specific, scalable mechanical loading to remodel. "Movement is nutrition" for tissues without direct blood supply.
- **The ROM Mandate**: Full range of motion (full joint flexion/extension) is the only way to condition end-range zones and stimulate synovial fluid circulation.
- **Short Range vs. Long Range Balance**:
  - **Short Range**: Movements in the shortened position (e.g., Sled/ROKP). Purpose: Pumping blood, low-damage, safe for daily frequency.
  - **Long Range**: Movements in the lengthened position (e.g., Split Squat). Purpose: Mechanical tension, structural remodeling, requires 48-72h recovery.

## 2. Decision Heuristics (Actions)
- **IF [Symptom: General Knee Pain / Tendonitis]**:
  - *ACTION 1*: **ROKP (Reverse Out Knee Pain)**. 5-10 minutes of backward sled dragging or "Deadmill" walking for synovial flushing.
  - *ACTION 2*: **Step-Up Continuum**. Regress to **Patrick Step** -> **Poliquin Step** -> **Peterson Step** until a pain-free baseline is found.
- **IF [Symptom: Lower Back Pain / Atrophied Erectors]**:
  - *ACTION 1*: **Seated Good Morning**. Isolate the adductors and spinal multifidus by removing hamstring tension.
  - *ACTION 2*: Check Hip Flexor length via the **ATG Split Squat**. If tight, back pain is likely a secondary symptom of anterior pelvic pull.
- **IF [Event: Acute Joint Stiffness / Early Stage Recovery]**:
  - *ACTION*: **Flossing Protocol**. 2 minutes of ischemic compression via latex bands + movement to trigger "Reperfusion" flush.
- **IF [Symptom: Shin Splints / Deceleration Trauma]**:
  - *ACTION*: **Tibialis Raise**. Strengthen the "first line of defense" (Tibialis Anterior) to absorb ground reaction forces.

## 3. Truth Anchors (Performance Standards)
- **The ATG Split Squat (Visual Gold Standard)**:
  - *Front Leg*: Hamstring covers calf (full flexion).
  - *Back Leg*: Straight, glute engaged, knee off ground (stretched hip flexor).
  - *Standard*: 25% Bodyweight per hand (50% total) for 8 reps/leg.
- **Structural Math (The Bulletproof Ratios)**:
  - **Tibialis Raise**: 20% Bodyweight x 20 reps.
  - **Nordic Curl**: Full eccentric control on bodyweight.
  - **Poliquin Step-Up**: 66% Bodyweight x 20 reps.
  - **External Rotation**: 10% Bodyweight x 8 reps (Shoulder stability).

## 4. Visual Benchmarks (Truth Calibration)
- **The Perfect Depth**: Hamstring making forceful contact with the calf in the squat/split squat. No "vertical shin" avoidance patterns.
- **Vertical Torso**: Upright posture in knee-dominant movements, indicating sufficient hip flexor length and core stabilization.
- **Red Flag**: Painful range of motion, "resting" injured joints instead of regressing them, or neglecting distal extremities (tibs/calves).
