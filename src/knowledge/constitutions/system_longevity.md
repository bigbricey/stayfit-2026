# Constitution: Longevity & Medicine 3.0 (The Centenarian Decathlon)
**Metabolic Logic: Biological Entropy Management & Functional Reserve Engineering**

## 1. The Laws of Medicine 3.0 (Parameters)
- **The Backcasting Rule**: Physical capacity must be engineered decades in advance. To be functional at 100, one must possess a "Massive Reserve" at 50, accounting for the ~1-3% annual decay of strength and power.
- **The ApoB Floor**: Apolipoprotein B is the primary driver of ASCVD. 
  - *Standard Lab Normal*: < 100 mg/dL.
  - *Longevity Optimal*: < 60 mg/dL (Early interdiction).
- **The Four Horsemen Interdiction**: Proactive risk management of Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer, Neurodegeneration, and Metabolic Dysfunction (T2D).
- **Zone 2 Base**: 3-4 hours/week of steady-state aerobic work (Lactate < 2.0 mmol/L). The "Talk Test" heuristic: able to speak but notably exercising.
- **VO2 Max Ceiling**: VO2 Max is the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality. Goal: Elite (Top 2.5%) for age/sex bracket.

## 2. Decision Heuristics (Actions)
- **IF [Metric: Grip Strength / Dead Hang < Standard]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: Global Frailty Risk.
  - *ACTION*: Prioritize **Farmer's Carries** (Bodyweight total load for 2 min) and **Dead Hangs** (2 min Male / 1.5 min Female).
- **IF [Objective: Mitochondrial Efficiency / Metabolic Flexibility]**:
  - *ACTION*: **Zone 2 Protocol**. 45-60 min sessions of steady-state output. No "Zone 3/4" drift; maintain "Talk Test" threshold.
- **IF [Event: Post-Saturate Inflammatory Recovery]**:
  - *ACTION 1*: **Sauna (Hyperthermed Resilience)**. 20 min @ 174°F+, 4-7x per week to trigger Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) and FOXO3.
  - *ACTION 2*: **Cold Immersion (Metabolic Activation)**. 11 min/week total (Søberg Principle). Do not use within 4h post-hypertrophy training.
- **IF [Symptom: Sleep Debt / Cognitive Fatigue]**:
  - *ACTION 1*: **Huberman Delay**. Wait 90-120 min post-waking for caffeine to allow adenosine clearance.
  - *ACTION 2*: **Thermal Downregulation**. Lower core temp by 2-3°F (cool room 65°F) + Magnesium Glycinate/Theanine/Apigenin stack.

## 3. Truth Anchors (Biological Metrics)
- **Sarcopenia Mathematics**: Strength declines faster than mass. The ability to Turkish Get-Up (Fall Recovery) is the ultimate survival proxy.
- **Centenarian Decathlon Events**: Carrying groceries (Grip), picking up a grandchild (Posterior Power), climbing 4 flights of stairs (VO2 Max).
- **The Metformin Schism**: Metformin is a tool for insulin resistance but a toxin for athletic adaptation. Avoid if pursuing hypertrophy/Zone 2 excellence.
- **Glymphatic Clearance**: Deep Sleep (Stage 3/4) is the only window for physical "brain washing" of metabolic waste.

## 4. Visual Benchmarks (Truth Calibration)
- **Functional Form**: Flat back in a Seated Good Morning, full ROM in a Squat, perfect geometry in a Split Squat.
- **Biomarker Dashboard**: Fasting Insulin < 6 uIU/mL, HbA1c < 5.4%, ApoB < 60 mg/dL.
- **Red Flag**: "Resume Virtues" without "Eulogy Virtues" (Physical robusticity with social/emotional isolation).
