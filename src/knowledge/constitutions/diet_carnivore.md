# Constitution: Carnivore / Animal-Based (The Apex Fuel Protocol)
**Metabolic Logic: Plant Toxin Elimination & Randle Cycle Resolution**

## 1. The Apex Laws (Parameters)
- **The Fat Lever (Ratios by weight)**:
  - **Therapeutic (PKD)**: 2:1 Fat-to-Protein (~82% calories from fat). *Indication: Autoimmune/Clinical.*
  - **Performance (Baker)**: 1:1 Fat-to-Protein (~70% calories from fat). *Indication: Athletic/Health.*
- **The Protein Ceiling**: Do not exceed 35-40% of total calories from protein (200g-300g absolute limit for most) to avoid **Rabbit Starvation** (urea cycle overload). 
- **Electrolyte Floor (Natriuresis Mitigation)**:
  - **Sodium**: 3,000mg - 5,000mg (Daily Requirement).
  - **Potassium**: 3,000mg - 4,700mg.
  - **Magnesium**: 300mg - 500mg (Chelated).
- **The Organ Mandate**: 
  - *Standard*: Muscle meat is sufficient if volume is high (>3-4lbs).
  - *Clinical*: Minimum 400g Liver + 200g Marrow/Brain per week (Paleomedicina protocol).
- **Zero-Tolerance Policy**: All seed oils, grains, legumes, and industrial "plant pesticides" (lectins/oxalates).

## 2. Decision Heuristics (Actions)
- **IF [Symptom: Explosive Diarrhea / Post-Prandial Urgency]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: Bile Acid Malabsorption (Bile Shock).
  - *ACTION 1*: **Transition Taper**. Switch to "Solid Fat" (Cold butter/suet) vs. "Rendered Fat" (tallow/grease) to slow gastric emptying.
  - *ACTION 2*: Drain ground beef grease until bile production (CYP7A1) upregulates.
- **IF [Symptom: Severe Autoimmune Flare / Stubborn Inflammation]**:
  - *ACTION*: **The Lion Diet Reset**. Eliminate poultry, pork, eggs, and dairy. Revert to Ruminant Meat (Beef/Lamb) + Salt + Water for 6-8 weeks.
- **IF [Symptom: Palpitations / Night Cramps / Dizziness]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: Electrolyte Dump (Fault Mode A).
  - *ACTION*: Administer **Ketoade** (Hypertonic Sodium/Potassium/Magnesium solution). Do not rely on "salting to taste."
- **IF [Objective: Long-term Hormonal Stability (Saladino Variant)]**:
  - *ACTION*: Introduce "Botanical Fruits" (Fruit/Honey) to trigger insulin-mediated electrolyte retention and T3 conversion. *Warning: Watch for Randle Cycle gridlock if fat remains ultra-high.*

## 3. Truth Anchors (Scientific Constants)
- **Lipid Energy Model (LEM)**: High LDL in lean/athletic carnivores (LMHR) is a marker of high energy trafficking via VLDL, not necessarily cardiovascular stagnation. Audit Triglycerides and HDL for context.
- **Randle Cycle Resolution**: Removing all plant starches resolves substrate competition at the mitochondria, allowing for uninhibited fat oxidation.
- **Demand-Driven GNG**: Protein does not "turn into sugar" unless the brain/RBCs require it. The fear of "steak-induced hyperglycemia" is unfounded in healthy physiology.

## 4. Visual Benchmarks (Truth Calibration)
- **The Anabolic Anchor**: A large fatty Ribeye or 80/20 Ground Beef. Fat and protein are visually balanced.
- **The Therapeutic Plate**: High-fat trimmings, suet, or cold butter dominant (80%+ calories from fat).
- **Red Flag**: Lean meats only (Rabbit Starvation risk), "Rendered Fat" boluses in a non-adapted gut, or inclusion of high-toxin "defense" plants (spinach/kale).
