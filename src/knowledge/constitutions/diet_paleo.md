# Constitution: Paleo / Ancestral (The Evolutionary Alignment Protocol)
**Metabolic Logic: Biological Congruence & Anti-Nutrient Mitigation**

## 1. The Ancestral Laws (Parameters)
- **The Omega Balance**: Target 1:1 ratio of Omega-6 (Linoleic Acid) to Omega-3. 
  - *Hard Ceiling*: Avoid all Industrial Seed Oils (Soybean, Corn, Canola).
  - *Action*: Prioritize Grass-fed ruminants and wild-caught fish.
- **The Fructose Ceiling**: 
  - *Standard*: < 25g/day (approx. 2-3 pieces of whole fruit).
  - *Clinical (Fat Loss)*: 10-25g/day.
  - *Danger Zone*: > 50g/day (Liver de novo lipogenesis threshold).
- **The Anti-Nutrient Ban**: 
  - **Zero Tolerance**: Cereal grains (wheat, corn, rice), Legumes (soy, beans, lentils), and Processed Dairy.
  - **The Phytic Acid Tax**: Nuts/Seeds must be soaked, sprouted, or blanched (skinless) to unlock minerals.
- **Sodium Floor**: 3,000mg - 5,000mg (Adjust upwards with activity). "Clean eating" removes 70% of standard salt intake; supplementation is mandatory to avoid "Paleo Fatigue."

## 2. Decision Heuristics (Actions)
- **IF [Symptom: Wakefulness at 3:00 AM / "Tired but Wired"]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: Nocturnal Hypoglycemic Cortisol Spike.
  - *ACTION*: "Carb Backloading." Move 50g of "Safe Starch" (Sweet Potato/Yam) to the final meal of the day to blunt cortisol and support serotonin.
- **IF [Event: High Carb or "Non-Ancestral" Intake]**:
  - *ACTION*: **The Walking Heuristic**. 20-30 mins of self-paced walking immediately post-meal to trigger GLUT4 glucose clearance without insulin dominance.
- **IF [Symptom: Stubborn Inflammation / Joint Pain]**:
  - *ACTION*: Shift to **AIP (Autoimmune Protocol) Safe Mode**. Remove Eggs (whites), Nightshades (Tomato/Potato/Peppers), and all Nuts/Seeds for 30 days.

## 3. Truth Anchors (Scientific Constants)
- **The Insulin-Renin Link**: Low insulin (from removing processed carbs) causes the kidneys to dump sodium. You are not "sick"; you are sodium-deficient.
- **The Almond Flour Fallacy**: Paleo "Treats" are pro-inflammatory traps. Caloric density and Omega-6 load from nut-flours negate the metabolic benefits of ancestral eating.
- **Individual Variance (N=1)**: Use the **7-Day Carb Test** to audit personal insulin sensitivity. If 50g of a starch results in >140mg/dL after 2 hours, it is a metabolic toxin for that individual.

## 4. Visual Benchmarks (Truth Calibration)
- **The Perfect Plate**: 60% Non-Starchy Veg (Volume) + 25% Animal Protein (The Anchor) + 10-15% Healthy Fats (Avocado/Olive Oil). 
- **The Safe Starch**: A palm-sized portion of Sweet Potato/Yam for active individuals or evening recovery.
- **Red Flag**: "Grain-free" packaged snacks, un-soaked raw nuts, or "Paleo" desserts using liquid sweeteners.
