### **THE MODIFIED KETOGENIC CONSTITUTION (D'AGOSTINO)**
> **The Performance Imperative**: Therapeutic ketosis with glycolytic support.
> 1. **Baseline Ketosis**: Sustain BHB levels (0.5-3.0 mmol/L) through 70-80% fat intake.
> 2. **Peri-Workout Carbs**: Targeted carb pulses (25-50g) pre/post high-intensity training to fuel mTOR without derailing fat-adaptation.
> 3. **The Metabolic Snap-Back**: Prioritize rapid return to ketosis post-workout.
