### **THE MODIFIED KETOGENIC CONSTITUTION (D'AGOSTINO)**
> **The Performance Imperative**: Therapeutic ketosis with glycolytic support.
> 1. **Baseline Ketosis**: Sustain BHB levels (0.5-3.0 mmol/L) through 70-80% fat intake.
> 2. **Peri-Workout Carbs**: Targeted carb pulses (25-50g) pre/post high-intensity training to fuel mTOR without derailing fat-adaptation.
> 3. **The Metabolic Snap-Back**: Prioritize rapid return to ketosis post-workout.

## 🧪 DEEP RESEARCH VAULT

### The Dual-Fuel Performance Engine (Dr. Dominic D'Agostino)

**Concept: Metabolic Flexibility**
*   **The Glycolytic Gap**: Standard keto can blunt the "top-end gear" (explosive power) due to PDH inhibition. 
*   **The Dual-Fuel Architecture**: The goal is to retain mitochondrial fat-burning machinery while priming glycolytic flux for high-intensity efforts (CrossFit, MMA, Sprints).

**Protocol I: The Modified Ketogenic Diet (MKD)**
*   **Protein Satiety**: 1.6–2.2 g/kg of protein is the "sink" for amino acids, buffering GNG while preserving muscle mass during fat loss (Gymnast Study).
*   **Carb Ceiling**: <50g total carbs, primarily from nutrient-dense green vegetables (Mediterranean Keto style).

**Protocol II: Targeted Ketogenic Diet (TKD)**
*   **The Glucose Pulse**: 25–50g of **Dextrose (Glucose)** 30 mins pre-workout. 
*   **Dextrose vs. Fructose**: Dextrose fuels skeletal muscle directly (GLUT4) and is "burned off" locally. Fructose refilling liver glycogen is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** as it halts systemic ketogenesis for much longer.
*   **Anabolic Signaling**: Use insulin pulses around training to activate mTOR and facilitate vasodilation (the "pump") without chronic elevation.

**Protocol III: The Metabolic Snap-Back**
*   **Zone 2 Catalyst**: Perform 20–30 mins of Zone 2 cardio post-workout to oxidize residual glucose/lactate, lower insulin, and "snap-back" into ketosis within 2-4 hours.
*   **Fast Syncing**: Intermittent Fasting (16:8) acts as a "Restart Button" for metabolic maintenance.

**Supplement Stack: The D'Agostino Protocol**
1.  **Ketone Salts + MCT Oil (C8)**: The salts provide immediate BHB/Electrolytes; MCTs stimulate the liver to sustain the state.
2.  **Acetyl-L-Carnitine**: Facilitates the fatty acid shuttle into mitochondria.
3.  **Goldilocks Zone**: Target **BHB 0.5–2.0 mM**. Exceeding 3.0 mM during exercise can cause "flat" performance.

### AI COACH LOGIC (Hardcoded Guardrails)
1.  **IF "Bonking" during HIIT**: Prescribe 25g Dextrose pre-workout (TKD).
2.  **IF Lethargy post-carb ingestion**: Initiate **Metabolic Snap-Back** (20 mins Zone 2).
3.  **IF GKI > 6**: Audit carb sources; ensure Fructose (fruit/sugar) is replaced with Dextrose for training pulses.
