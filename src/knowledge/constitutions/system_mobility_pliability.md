# Constitution: Mobility & Pliability (The Supple Leopard Protocol)
**Metabolic Logic: Biotensegrity Restoration & Neurological Range Control**

## 1. The Laws of Movement (Parameters)
- **Active Mobility vs. Passive Flexibility**: Passive flexibility is a "zone of uselessness." The goal is **Mobility**: the ability to actively control a range of motion. Close the "Mobility Gap" to prevent injury.
- **Joint Capsule Priority**: If the "hinge" is rusty, stretching the "cable" (muscle) is futile. Use **Banded Distrations** to clear joint capsule restrictions before soft tissue work.
- **Torque and Stability**: Generate rotational torque (e.g., "breaking the bar") to screw bones into the socket, creating a "close-packed" stable joint position.
- **The Fascial Net (Tensegrity)**: Dysfunction is systemic. A tight ankle can cause neck pain via the **Superficial Back Line**. Move in "Varied Vectors" (spirals/diagonals) to hydrate matted fascia.
- **Pliability (Tissue Quality)**: At rest, muscles must be "Long and Soft" to function as efficient metabolic pumps. Dense/Stiff muscles are brittle and ischemia-prone.

## 2. Decision Heuristics (Actions)
- **IF [Symptom: Pinching in Joint (Front of Hip/Ankle)]**:
  - *DIAGNOSIS*: Capsular Impingement / Bony Block.
  - *ACTION*: **Banded Joint Distraction**. Use heavy bands to pull the joint surfaces apart while moving into the restricted range.
- **IF [Symptom: Tightness in Muscle Belly / Shortened ROM]**:
  - *ACTION 1 (Neurological)*: **PAILs/RAILs**. High-tension isometric contractions at the end range to "re-program" the nervous system's safety brake.
  - *ACTION 2 (Mechanical)*: **Pin and Stretch Shearing**. Pin the tissue with a roller and actively move the limb to shear fascial layers apart.
- **IF [Pre-Workout / Pre-Activity]**:
  - *HEURISTIC*: **Dynamic Stretching ONLY**. Leg swings, lunges, rotations. Increase temp and neural drive without triggering autogenic inhibition.
- **IF [Post-Workout / Remedial Session]**:
  - *HEURISTIC*: **Static Stretching / SMR (Pliability)**. Use holds (>60s) or vibration (20-30Hz) to induce relaxation and structural remodeling.

## 3. Truth Anchors (Performance Benchmarks)
- **Deep Squat Archetype (FMS)**: Hamstrings touching calves, heels flat, upright torso. The baseline diagnostic for human movement.
- **Knee-to-Wall Test**: Big toe 5 inches from wall; knee must touch wall without heel lift. Binary pass/fail for ankle health.
- **The Beighton Score**: If >5/9, the user is hypermobile. *REVERSAL*: Stop stretching; prioritize **Stability and Isometrics** to stiffen the joints.
- **The Mortality Correlates**:
  - **Sitting-Rising Test (SRT)**: Sit and stand from floor without support. A score <8 is a high-signal proxy for biological frailty.
  - **10-Second One-Leg Stand**: Essential proxy for neurological/vestibular health. Inability to hold is a "canary in the coal mine" for decline.

## 4. Visual Benchmarks (Truth Calibration)
- **The Supple Leopard**: Fluid, organized movement through full ROM without compensation (e.g., no lumbar rounding to find depth).
- **The "Peanut" Fulcrum**: Mobile Thoracic spine (T-spine) capable of extension over a small fulcrum without rib-flare.
- **Red Flag**: "Vertical Shins" in a squat, "tech-neck" kyphosis, or relying on passive stiffness for stability instead of muscular torque.
